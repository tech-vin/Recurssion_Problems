## Here are 10 relatively easy recursion questions to help you practice:

1. **Factorial Calculation:**
   Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer 'n'.

2. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   Implement a recursive function to find the nth term in the Fibonacci sequence.

3. **Sum of Digits:**
   Write a recursive function to find the sum of digits of a given positive integer.

4. **Power Calculation:**
   Implement a recursive function to calculate the power of a number 'base' raised to an exponent 'exponent'.

5. **Counting Down:**
   Write a recursive function to count down from a given positive integer to 1.

6. **Array Sum:**
   Implement a recursive function to find the sum of elements in an integer array.

7. **Palindrome Check:**
   Create a recursive function to determine if a given string is a palindrome.

8. **Binary Search:**
   Write a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array.

9. **Print Numbers:**
   Implement a recursive function to print numbers from 1 to n.

10. **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):**
    Write a recursive function to find the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
